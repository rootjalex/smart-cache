# 6.824 Final Project

Final project for [Meia Alsup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meiaalsup/), [Amir Farhat](https://github.com/amirfarhat) [Alexander Root](https://rootjalex.github.io) for our [Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/) class. We are implementing a smart caching system, for use in large distributed databases, when there are patterns in the data accesses.

## Paper
Report describing Smart-Cache

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

We rely on Go's testing infrastructure. From the root of the repository, run:

```
cd src
go test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Example
